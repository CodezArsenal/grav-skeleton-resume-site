## Basic Setup for a new Grav site

The simplest way to install Resume theme for Grav is to download and install the Resume Skeleton package:

2. Simply unzip the package into your web root folder.
3. Point your browser at the folder, job done!

**TIP:** Check out the [general Grav installation instructions](http://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation) for more details on this process.

## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Resume theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-resume)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Resume Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install resume
```
