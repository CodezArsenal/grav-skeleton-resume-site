I'm a 25 years old Art Director & Freelance Designer from Valladolid (Spain) currently based in Madrid. I love everything that has to do with Web design & development, Graphic design, Packaging, Industrial design and I feel a true devotion for typography.

I have 4 years of experience working as a freelance and working on an studio, but and Iâ€™m ready for visiting other countries & work for any design studio! I love working with people, specially if they have the same passion I have for what they do. 

Why don't we work together? Go futher down to see why I am the man you need to hire!
